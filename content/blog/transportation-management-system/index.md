Transport Management Systems (TMSs) available on the market either didn’t
meet our client’s specific needs, didn’t take into account crucial issues
when automating processes, or couldn’t be integrated with the systems our
client already used.

## Project summary

That’s why he decided to create a SaaS solution tailored to his company’s
business needs. Moreover, he decided to make it available as a cloud solution
for the open market. Together, we created a TMS that can tackle common pain
points of logistics companies.

Smart Logistics is a SaaS solution for transportation management. This
transportation management system allows companies to perform warehouse
operations, manage loads, optimize routes, provide mature visibility, and
automate a huge part of problem solving. The system can also be integrated
with existing solutions, including any type of WMS, ERP, and invoicing software.

## Challenges to overcome

- Too much time is spent onboarding. Existing solutions are complex.
- A logistics manager spends 2 to 6 hours building a delivery route for 20 to 30 vehicles for one day.
- Managers spend 2 to 3 hours a day on routine communications and problem-solving.
